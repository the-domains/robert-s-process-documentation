# BuildaSign

**Brand DNA**

Role: Creative Director

We built out a series of affinitization exercises for the executives, stakeholders and owners to participate in. Together, we were able to identify key user personas, which we used to sketch out a series of identity spectrums for discussion.

Key takeaways were:

Competent, but approachable.

The tone, despite the business being fairly B2B, would be casual and friendly.

Customer Service should be front and center.

The call center, branded as "Customer Love," and the Giving arm of the organization would be highlighted, providing a human element as a differentiator in the space.

The technology is really all about service.

The look and feel would need to connote technology, but not be overly sterile.

**The Modular Build**

Role: Art director, UX designer and Lead Designer.

Role: Creative Director, UX Primary

The legacy BuildaSign site was the product of many years of conversion optimization. Different pages from different eras existed simply because they won an split test at some point. We therefore had hundreds of pages that diverge wildly with respect to look and feel and UX.

We also did not have any real solution with respect to mobile or tablet. 30% of visits were not being addressed.

Because of the highly modular nature of multi-variate testing, our goal was to design the overall UX in an atomic fashion.

It was then necessary to audit the existing site structure and combine this with our user stories to devise a set of interchangeable content units.

These were created in conjunction with the front end developer's pattern guide, which allowed us to rapidly edit and prototype a live version of the site instead of just showing flat mockups.
